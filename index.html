      <p>I'm an Accountant professional who fell in love with creating websites. 
        Ever since then i've been working towards making a transition to that field. 
        I was always interested in gaining some sort of technical skill. However, 
        I never believe it would have happened because my thinking was you had to have a computer science degree in order to do so. 
        i was eager to learn and create as much as i can.</p>

        <p>After going through several YouTube videosI learned it was best to start with Java. 
          This was the most hair pulling times of my life. I decided to go back to the drawing board 
        and did some more research. I learned python was a bit easier and more preffered language for 
      beginners. It was fun to learning python however it was not what i wanted to do. It wasn't until 
    I found <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp.com</a> that i realized web develoment was 
  more align with what I truly wanted to do and what I was passionate about. </p>
